<p>We have worked for several large multi-national companies,

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="#Top">Top...</a>

</ul>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="#Top">Top...</a>
<h3><a name="MIS">Management Information and Control systems</a></h3>
<p>Managing without statistical reporting and control tools is a high risk activity.
Without some form of regular management reporting, the financial reports of a business 
unit can come as a surprise each month.</p>
<p>We can help you to identify the statistics which will put you back in control of your business, 
and create systems that will measure and report on how your business is running.</p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="#Top">Top...</a>
<h3><a name="HR">Human Resources, including complement control</a></h3>
<p>There are several good Human Resources packages on the market, but installing, configuring, and implementing an HR system is complex and sensitive.</p>
<p>While the use of computer systems may improve productivity and control, inattention to the human side of such systems can be extremely costly.</p>
<p>Human Resources are a critical asset in all <q>knowledge intensive</q> businesses, and the value of these assets should be correctly exploited to contribute to profitability.
Unfortunately, the cost of these resources continues to escalate, and are notoriously difficult to control.</p>
<p>We have experience in implementing Human Resources systems that help managers to develop the potential and performance of their staff and measure individual contribution, while maintaining the records required by law and good practice.</p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="#Top">Top...</a>
<h3><a name="PMS">Performance Management Systems</a></h3>
<p>We can help you to develop &quot;Key Performance Indicators (KPI)&quot; which measure the &quot;Key Performance Areas (KPA)&quot; of your staff.
Using these, you will be able to measure and influence the activities which control the revenue streams of your business.
You will be able to identify your top performers, and those at the other end of the scale!
We also help you to select and set measurable performance standards, which, when breached, trigger performance management procedures which will result in an improvement in performance to acceptable levels or the replacement of the non-performer.</p>
<p>To support these management processes, we can design and build measurement and reporting systems which will maintain the statistics that will back you up in any conciliation or arbitration discussions that may be necessary.
</p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="#Top">Top...</a>
<h3><a name="Budget">Budgetting and forecasting systems</a></h3>
<p>Financial planning in a changing environment is a complex task which requires
skilled resources, generally at times when senior management is very busy.
We are able to implement and control financial planning processes,
in support of senior management, using accepted tools and techniques.
</p>
<p>We are also able to carry the financial plans produced into costing and
management reporting systems, which results in an improved likelyhood of achieving
successful implementation of those plans.
</p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="#Top">Top...</a>
<h3><a name="Cost">Costing systems</a></h3>
<p>We are able to design and implement cost control and reporting systems
which give meaningful forcasts of end of period expenditure against budget,
even where the financial environment is complex.
</p>
<p>Costing systems are often seen as a tool of Accountants, with little benefit
for line management in an organisation.
We believe that we can develop costing system solutions which put necessary
information in the hands of line managers and enable them to manage their
operations with financial confidence.
</p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="#Top">Top...</a>
<h3><a name="Shares">Share Registration and Investment Recording systems</a></h3>
<p>With the advent of the JSE STRATE model of electronic share trading in a dematerialised environment, 
the investment recording systems of some companies and individuals need revision and, sometimes, replacement.</p>
<p>We have qualifications (South African Institute of Financial Management) and experience in the 
development and maintenance of investment recording and decision support systems.</p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="#Top">Top...</a>
<h3><a name="CRM">Customer Relationship Management systems</a></h3>
<p>It is possible to spend vast sums of money on Customer Relationship Management (CRM) systems without actually achieving commensurate benefits.
</p>
<p>We have experience with managing customer experiences, and can focus attention on the
key aspects of CRM which encourage your customers to be loyal to your brand.
</p>
<p>We can also supply selected CRM application system components at very competitive prices.
</p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="#Top">Top...</a>
<h3><a name="CC">Contact Centre support, management and control</a></h3>
<p>Many companies have created Call Centres, but few senior executives are satisfied
that the expected benefits are being achieved.  Even fewer customers are satisfied with
Call Centre service.
</p>
<p>The creation and management of a Contact Centre is even more difficult to manage.
There are significant challenges in the technology, people, and processes associated
with the running of a Contact Centre, and with the management of performance.
</p>
<p>We have experience and resources that make managing a successful Contact Centre possible.</p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="#Top">Top...</a>
<h3><a name="Conv">Conversions and unusual application challenges</a></h3>
<p>Some conversions have more challenges than others, particularly when data formats differ 
(e.g. IBM MVS and Unix), or when operating system facilities are incompatible (e.g. print spooling).</p>
<p>New products and standards permit implementations which are better suited to business problems 
than those of the past (e.g. XML, web services, SOA).</p>
<p>We have, and can create, productivity tools that assist in the conversion of data and programs 
between otherwise incompatible systems and environments.
In particular, we have tools which can parse and manipulate text, including source code, and reformat it intelligently.</p>
<p>We are also familiar with the models of different types of database (e.g. relational, network, hierarchical, custom) and can devise appropriate conversion strategies between them.</p>
